library

collection of utility classes that add to the core stl / std / tr1 library system.

This is designed to add to c++0x, and leverage the language and library features added in this newest revision of C++.

Features:
- stream i/o and stream buffer additions to enable additional features for i/o
- miscellaneous string functions
- basic encapsulation of some O.S. dependent functions
- code constructs for "better" coding style and improved code reliability
